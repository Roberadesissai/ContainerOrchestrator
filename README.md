## 🛠️ Getting Started 🛠️

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Docker and Kubernetes.
- Docker installed on your system.
- Kubernetes cluster set up (e.g., Minikube or a cloud-based Kubernetes service).
- A code editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git installed on your system.
- A GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine to get started. Navigate to your desired location via the terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ContainerOrchestrator.git
```

### Explore Docker

Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd ContainerOrchestrator
```

#### Build a Docker Image

Here's a simple example of a Dockerfile to build a basic Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js runtime as a base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Install the application dependencies
RUN npm install

# Expose port 8080 for the application
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

Build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t yourusername/node-app .
```

#### Pull and Push Docker Images

Pull an existing Docker image:

```bash
docker pull yourusername/node-app
```

Push your newly created Docker image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push yourusername/node-app
```

### Explore Kubernetes

#### Deploying Your Application

Create a simple deployment YAML file (e.g., `deployment.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-app
        image: yourusername/node-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
